If you've stumbled upon this nice little piece of software, probably
it was for good reason ;-)

The setup is as simple as this:

- Put the contents of /htdocs on an internal web server

- Add a handler for ".dat" files to PERL in web server config

- Define your config file path in "wpad.dat" PERL file

- Define location names and networks in network.list

- Define proxies for locations in locations.list

- Point "Proxy Autconfig URL" in your browser to
  your http://webserver/wpad.dat

- Have fun!
